# TDF Starters Remaining-Useful-Life (RUL)

## Intro
This little project uses a neural network with LSTM-cells to predict the career end of Tour de France starters. To train the network, data about Tour de France starters between 1995 to 2019 from the excellent ressource https://www.procyclingstats.com has been scrapped. The scrapped data was then brought into the long-format and some features such as a cumulative count of years riding for a WorldTour/ProContinental/Continental-Team have been added. This data was then feed into a rather simple neural network with two layers of LSTM cells and a dense output layer with one cell and a linear activation function. The final model resulted in a RMSE of 2.304 and R2 of 0.679.
The model therefore gives a rough estimate on when a rider will end his career, but should also be seen in the light of the project's weaknesses: Data quality could be enhanced, as riders with breaks in their careers such as doping-bans or being with out a contract are considered as "career ended". Further, the integration of non-time varying variables could be done via a multi-input network architecture. The network's hyperparameters and the number of features could be enhanced in the futur, in order to obtain better results.
Inspirations for this project were taken from RUL-projects such as https://github.com/gm-spacagna/deep-ttf/ and https://github.com/LahiruJayasinghe/RUL-Net
